NetworkEditorDraft
==================

This is a draft demo code for the NetworkEditor application.
The main goal of the project is to demonstrate the possibilities of
- TypeScript language itself
- Desktop-like UI
- GoogleMaps, MarkerClusterer API and integration with TypeScript
- Ext.js
- Module system (future)
- Angular.js UI system (might be possible in some future)

The current code might not be working. Keep calm - this is the part of prototype application and I'm going to spent some time to make it working. The only thing - I can't promise when.
